# Say _Hello_ to Kel.
Ever wanted to create a simple, static website but didn't want to do all the work coding individual pages in HTML and then updating those HTML pages? Love Markdown so much that you've nearly forgotten how to do markup in HTML? Well, say _hello_ to Kel, the ridiculously simple static website system for NodeJS. 

# Features.

		</td>
		<td width=33%>
			<h3>Try NoDB</h3>
			<p>Kel uses no databases - <b>none, zilch, zero</b>. It simply uses files with the extension '.md' from a single folder.</p>

		<td width=33%>
			<h3>You're In Control</h3>
			<p>No more struggling to make a CMS do what you want. Write your own content and your own template in your own language.</p>
