# About.
Kel is a ridiculously simple markdown file-based website system built on Express, CoffeeScript and NodeJS. It is super easy to setup, simple as anything and as flexible as you can make it. Kel has been lovingly handcoded by Alexander Yuen of [KOO Studios](http://www.koostudios.com).

## Name and Philosophy.
Kel is named after Kelly Johnson, the system engineer who first articulated the design principle of KISS. Kel keeps to the "keep it short and simple" guideline  and avoid unnecessary complexity as much as possible.
